I&rsquo;ll come as often as I can, of course; but it won&rsquo;t be the same as being around with you all the time. The other thing is even worse. You see, it was a Methodist revival father got converted in, and so of course he joined the Methodist church. He wasn&rsquo;t anything before. He used to say he was a Nothingarian and lived up to it&mdash;kind of bragging like. But he&rsquo;s a strong Methodist now, and is going to go to Markdale Methodist church and pay to the salary. Now what&rsquo;ll he say when I tell him I&rsquo;m a Presbyterian?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
