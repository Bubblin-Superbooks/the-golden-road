Of course, it will be lovely to be with father, but oh, I&rsquo;ll miss the rest of you so much!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just think how WE&rsquo;LL miss YOU,&rdquo; sighed Cecily. &ldquo;It will be so lonesome here this winter, with you and Peter both gone. Oh, dear, I do wish things didn&rsquo;t have to change.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
