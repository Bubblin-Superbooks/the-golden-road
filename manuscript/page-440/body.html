<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This is a true joke and really happened. It&rsquo;s about Mr. Samuel Clask again. He was once leading a prayer meeting and he looked through the window and saw the constable driving up and guessed he was after him because he was always in debt. So in a great hurry he called on Brother Casey to lead in prayer and while Brother Casey was praying with his eyes shut and everybody else had their heads bowed Mr. Clask got out of the window and got away before the constable got in because he didn&rsquo;t like to come in till the prayer was finished.</p><p>Uncle Roger says it was a smart trick on Mr. Clask&rsquo;s part, but I don&rsquo;t think there was much religion about it.</p></div> </div>
