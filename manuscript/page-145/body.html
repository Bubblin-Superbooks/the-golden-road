But you run over home for a loaf of stale bread, Sara, and it&rsquo;s a good idea about the rusks. I&rsquo;ll make a panful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me make them,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, eagerly. &ldquo;I can make real good rusks now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t do to trust you,&rdquo; said Felicity mercilessly. &ldquo;You might make some queer mistake and Aunt Eliza would tell it all over the country. She&rsquo;s a fearful old gossip. I&rsquo;ll make the rusks myself. She hates cats, so we mustn&rsquo;t let Paddy be seen. And she&rsquo;s a Methodist, so mind nobody says anything against Methodists to her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
