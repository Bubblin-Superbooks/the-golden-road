<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It was very foolish of you,&rdquo; said practical Aunt Janet. &ldquo;These September nights are real chilly. You might have caught your death of cold&mdash;or a bad dose of rheumatism.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I might. No doubt it was foolish of me,&rdquo; agreed Uncle Blair gaily. &ldquo;It must have been the fault, of the moonlight. Moonlight, you know, Sister Janet, has an intoxicating quality. It is a fine, airy, silver wine, such as fairies may drink at their revels, unharmed of it; but when a mere mortal sips of it, it mounts straightway to his brain, to the undoing of his daylight common sense. However, I have got neither cold nor rheumatism, as a sensible person would have done had he ever been lured into doing such a non-sensible thing; there is a special Providence for us foolish folk.</p></div> </div>
