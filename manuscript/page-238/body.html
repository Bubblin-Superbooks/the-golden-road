Mary Martha Cowan saw them doing it in town and started us doing it here. I always wear Kitty&rsquo;s ribbon and Kitty wears mine, but the Story Girl thinks it is silly.</p><p>CECILY KING.</p><p>AN ACCOUNT OF OUR VISIT TO COUSIN MATTIE&rsquo;S</p><p>We all walked over to Cousin Mattie&rsquo;s last week. They were all well there and we had a fine dinner. On our way back a snow-storm came up and we got lost in the woods. We didn&rsquo;t know where we were or nothing. If we hadn&rsquo;t seen a light I guess we&rsquo;d all have been frozen and snowed over, and they would never have found us till spring and that would be very sad. But we saw a light and made for it and it was Peg Bowen&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
