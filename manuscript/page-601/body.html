<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the Story Girl.</p><p>&ldquo;To &lsquo;the woods that belt the gray hillside&rsquo;&mdash;ay, and overflow beyond it into many a valley purple-folded in immemorial peace,&rdquo; answered Uncle Blair. &ldquo;I have a fancy for one more ramble in Prince Edward Island woods before I leave Canada again. But I would not go alone. So come, you two gay youthful things to whom all life is yet fair and good, and we will seek the path to Arcady. There will be many little things along our way to make us glad. Joyful sounds will &lsquo;come ringing down the wind;&rsquo; a wealth of gypsy gold will be ours for the gathering; we will learn the potent, unutterable charm of a dim spruce wood and the grace of flexile mountain ashes fringing a lonely glen; we will tryst with the folk of fur and feather; we&rsquo;ll hearken to the music of gray old firs.</p></div> </div>
