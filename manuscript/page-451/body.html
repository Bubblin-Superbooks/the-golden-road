That epitaph was quite famous among the little family traditions that entwine every household with mingled mirth and sorrow, smiles and tears. It had a perennial fascination for us and we read it over every Sunday. Cut deeply in the upright slab of red Island sandstone, the epitaph ran as follows:&mdash;</p><p>SWEET DEPARTED SPIRIT</p><p>Do receive the vows a grateful widow pays, Each future day and night shall hear her speak her Isaac&rsquo;s praise. Though thy beloved form must in the grave decay Yet from her heart thy memory no time, no change shall steal away. Do thou from mansions of eternal bliss Remember thy distressed relict. Look on her with an angel&rsquo;s love&mdash; Soothe her sad life and cheer her end Through this world&rsquo;s dangers and its griefs. Then meet her with thy well-known smiles and welcome At the last great day.</p></div> </div>
