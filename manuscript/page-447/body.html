He wrote a lot of things that weren&rsquo;t true, just like Valeria, and he wrote swear words too. Valeria never does that. Her characters all talk in a very refined fashion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I always skip the swear words,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;And Mr. Marwood said once that the Bible and Shakespeare would furnish any library well. So you see he put them together, but I&rsquo;m sure that he would never say that the Bible and Valeria would make a library.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
