<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On New Year&rsquo;s Eve we were all together in Uncle Alec&rsquo;s kitchen, which was tacitly given over to our revels during the winter evenings. The Story Girl and Peter were there, of course, and Sara Ray&rsquo;s mother had allowed her to come up on condition that she should be home by eight sharp. Cecily was glad to see her, but the boys never hailed her arrival with over-much delight, because, since the dark began to come down early, Aunt Janet always made one of us walk down home with her. We hated this, because Sara Ray was always so maddeningly self-conscious of having an escort. We knew perfectly well that next day in school she would tell her chums as a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; secret that &ldquo;So-and-So King saw her home&rdquo; from the hill farm the night before.</p></div> </div>
