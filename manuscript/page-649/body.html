It was so hard to imagine Sara Ray as having any kind of future. Yet Sara was plainly anxious to have her fortune told and must be gratified.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be married,&rdquo; said the Story Girl recklessly, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll live to be nearly a hundred years old, and go to dozens of funerals and have a great many sick spells. You will learn not to cry after you are seventy; but your husband will never go to church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you warned me,&rdquo; said Sara Ray solemnly, &ldquo;because now I know I&rsquo;ll make him promise before I marry him that he will go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
