<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There are some things in them I cannot understand. I like the stories of Valeria H. Montague in the Family Guide ever so much better. They are more exciting and truer to life. Romeo and Juliet was one of the plays I read. It was very sad. Juliet dies and I don&rsquo;t like stories where people die. I like it better when they all get married especially to dukes and earls. Shakespeare himself was married to Anne Hatheway. They are both dead now. They have been dead a good while. He was a very famous man.</p><p>FELICITY KING.</p><p>(PETER, MODESTLY: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about Shakespeare myself but I&rsquo;ve got a book of his plays that belonged to my Aunt Jane, and I guess I&rsquo;ll have to tackle him as soon as I finish with the Bible.&rdquo;)</p></div> </div>
