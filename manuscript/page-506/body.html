You must just wait till the evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder what it is,&rdquo; speculated Cecily, as the Story Girl left the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s much of anything,&rdquo; said Felicity, beginning to clear away the breakfast dishes. &ldquo;The Story Girl always likes to make so much out of so little. Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t believe Miss Reade is going to be married. She hasn&rsquo;t any beaus around here and Mrs. Armstrong says she&rsquo;s sure she doesn&rsquo;t correspond with anybody. Besides, if she was she wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to tell the Story Girl.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
