I never call there for she never seems to have anything to eat in the house. She was a Clayton and the Claytons never could cook. Maria sorter looks as if she&rsquo;d shrunk in the wash, now, don&rsquo;t she? And there&rsquo;s Douglas Nicholson. His brother put rat poison in the family pancakes. Nice little trick that, wasn&rsquo;t it? They say it was by mistake. I hope it WAS a mistake. His wife is all rigged out in silk. Yez wouldn&rsquo;t think to look at her she was married in cotton&mdash;and mighty thankful to get married in anything, it&rsquo;s my opinion. There&rsquo;s Timothy Patterson.</p></div> </div>
