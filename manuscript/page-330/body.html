I think you are going to have a nice figure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But just look at my hands,&rdquo; moaned Sara. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re simply covered with warts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the warts will all disappear before you grow up,&rdquo; said Cecily.</p><p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t disappear before the school concert. How am I to get up there and recite? You know there is one line in my recitation, &lsquo;She waved her lily-white hand,&rsquo; and I have to wave mine when I say it. Fancy waving a lily-white hand all covered with warts.</p></div> </div>
