<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The name of the sailing vessel was the Seth Hall, and the captain&rsquo;s name was Seth Hall, too. Captain Hall was a dreadfully profane man and used to swear blood-curdling oaths. On the night he sailed out of Markdale Harbour the old sailors warned him that a storm was brewing and that it would catch him if he did not wait until it was over. The captain had become very impatient because of several delays he had already met with, and he was in a furious temper. He swore a wicked oath that he would sail out of Markdale Harbour that night and &lsquo;God Almighty Himself shouldn&rsquo;t catch him.&rsquo; He did sail out of the harbour; and the storm did catch him, and the Seth Hall went down with all hands, the dead and the living finding a watery grave together. So the poor old mother up in Maine never had her boys brought back to her after all.</p></div> </div>
