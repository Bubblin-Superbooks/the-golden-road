He used to preach and pray and visit the sick just like a regular minister. One day he was visiting a neighbour who was dying and he prayed the Lord to have mercy on him because he was very poor and had worked so hard all his life that he hadn&rsquo;t much time to attend to religion.</p><p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t believe me, O Lord,&rdquo; Mr. Clask finished up with, &ldquo;just take a look at his hands.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
