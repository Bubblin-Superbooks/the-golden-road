And I&rsquo;ve heard ma teasing father about it, too. Of course, it was before father got acquainted with mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your father marry her?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she just simply wouldn&rsquo;t marry him in the end. She got over being in love with him. I guess she was pretty fickle. Aunt Olivia said father felt awful about it for awhile, but he got over it when he met ma. Ma was twice as good-looking as Agnes Clark. Agnes was a sight for freckles, so Aunt Olivia says. But she and father remained real good friends. Just think, if she had married him we would have been the children of the Governor&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
