What IS the wind?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I stammered.</p><p>&ldquo;No more do I,&rdquo; said Peg, &ldquo;and nobody knows. Nobody knows what the wind is. I wish I could find out. I mightn&rsquo;t be so afraid of the wind if I knew what it was. I am afraid of it. When the blasts come like that I want to crouch down and hide me. But I can tell you one thing about the wind&mdash;it&rsquo;s the only free thing in the world&mdash;THE&mdash;ONLY&mdash;FREE&mdash;THING. Everything else is subject to some law, but the wind is FREE. It bloweth where it listeth and no man can tame it. It&rsquo;s free&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I love it, though I&rsquo;m afraid of it. It&rsquo;s a grand thing to be free&mdash;free free&mdash;free!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
