Miss Sara Ray.</p><p>EDITORIAL</p><p>The editor wishes to make a few remarks about the Resolution Honour Roll. As will be seen, only one name figures on it. Felicity says she has thought a beautiful thought every morning before breakfast without missing one morning, not even the one we were at Peg Bowen&rsquo;s. Some of our number think it not fair that Felicity should be on the honour roll (FELICITY, ASIDE: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Dan, of course.&rdquo;) when she only made one resolution and won&rsquo;t tell us what any of the thoughts were. So we have decided to give honourable mention to everybody who has kept one resolution perfect. Felix has worked all his arithmetic problems by himself.</p></div> </div>
