<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a four-leaved clover,&rdquo; answered Peter exultantly. &ldquo;That means good luck for the summer. I found it in Markdale. There ain&rsquo;t much clover in Carlisle this year of any kind of leaf. The crop is going to be a failure. Your Uncle Roger says it&rsquo;s because there ain&rsquo;t enough old maids in Carlisle. There&rsquo;s lots of them in Markdale, and that&rsquo;s the reason, he says, why they always have such good clover crops there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth have old maids to do with it?&rdquo; cried Cecily.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ve a single thing to do with it, but Mr. Roger says they have, and he says a man called Darwin proved it. This is the rigmarole he got off to me the other day.</p></div> </div>
