I want to get acquainted with my&mdash;my nephews and nieces,&rdquo; said Aunt Eliza, with a rather pleasant glance around our group. If I could have associated the thought of such a thing with my preconception of Great-aunt Eliza I could have sworn there was a twinkle in her eye. But of course it was impossible. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you introduce yourselves, please?&rdquo;</p><p>Felicity shouted our names and Great-aunt Eliza shook hands all round. She performed the duty grimly and I concluded I must have been mistaken about the twinkle. She was certainly very tall and dignified and imposing&mdash;altogether a great-aunt to be respected.</p></div> </div>
