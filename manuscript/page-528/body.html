<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jasper Dale lived alone in the old homestead which he had named Golden Milestone. In Carlisle this giving one&rsquo;s farm a name was looked upon as a piece of affectation; but if a place must be named why not give it a sensible name with some meaning to it? Why Golden Milestone, when Pinewood or Hillslope or, if you wanted to be very fanciful, Ivy Lodge, might be had for the taking?</p><p>He had lived alone at Golden Milestone since his mother&rsquo;s death; he had been twenty then and he was close upon forty now, though he did not look it. But neither could it be said that he looked young; he had never at any time looked young with common youth; there had always been something in his appearance that stamped him as different from the ordinary run of men, and, apart from his shyness, built up an intangible, invisible barrier between him and his kind.</p></div> </div>
