So I sailed for Montreal without further delay. I got here at eleven last night&mdash;the station-master&rsquo;s son drove me down. Nice boy. The old house was in darkness and I thought it would be a shame to rouse you all out of bed after a hard day&rsquo;s work. So I decided that I would spend the night in the orchard. It was moonlight, you know, and moonlight in an old orchard is one of the few things left over from the Golden Age.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
