<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was that in Uncle Blair&rsquo;s voice that kept us silent for a time. Then the Story Girl said, still very softly:</p><p>&ldquo;What did mother look like, father? I don&rsquo;t look the least little bit like her, do I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I wish you did, you brown thing. Your mother&rsquo;s face was as white as a wood-lily, with only a faint dream of rose in her cheeks. She had the eyes of one who always had a song in her heart&mdash;blue as a mist, those eyes were. She had dark lashes, and a little red mouth that quivered when she was very sad or very happy like a crimson rose too rudely shaken by the wind. She was as slim and lithe as a young, white-stemmed birch tree. How I loved her! How happy we were! But he who accepts human love must bind it to his soul with pain, and she is not lost to me. Nothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
