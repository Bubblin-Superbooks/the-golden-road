<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We obtained permission to go without much difficulty, although the spring evening was wearing late, for Aunt Janet said she supposed none of us would sleep a wink that night if we didn&rsquo;t. A joyful procession followed the Awkward Man and the Story Girl across the gray, star-litten meadows to his home and through his pine-guarded gate.</p><p>&ldquo;You know that old barn of mine back in the woods?&rdquo; said the Awkward Man. &ldquo;I go to it only about once in a blue moon. There was an old barrel there, upside down, one side resting on a block of wood. This morning I went to the barn to see about having some hay hauled home, and I had occasion to move the barrel. I noticed that it seemed to have been moved slightly since my last visit, and it was now resting wholly on the floor. I lifted it up&mdash;and there was a cat lying on the floor under it.</p></div> </div>
