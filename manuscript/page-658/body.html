<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The first thing I thought was, what has happened, because I really didn&rsquo;t know at first, it was so sudden. Then after a spell I thought the answer, I am falling off the loft. And then I thought, what will happen to me when I strike the floor, and after another little spell I thought, I&rsquo;ll be killed. And then I thought, well, I don&rsquo;t care. I really wasn&rsquo;t a bit frightened. I just was quite willing to be killed. If there hadn&rsquo;t been a big pile of chaff on the barn floor these words would never have been written. But there was and I fell on it and wasn&rsquo;t a bit hurt, only my hair and mouth and eyes and ears got all full of chaff. The strange part is that I wasn&rsquo;t a bit frightened when I thought I was going to be killed, but after all the danger was over I was awfully frightened and trembled so the Story Girl had to help me into the house.</p></div> </div>
