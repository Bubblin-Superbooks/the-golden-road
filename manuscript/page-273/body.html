<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had heard you had lost yours and I took it this was your pet. I was afraid he was dead at first. He was lying there with his eyes closed; but when I bent over him he opened them and gave a pitiful little mew; or rather his mouth made the motion of a mew, for he was too weak to utter a sound.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, poor, poor Paddy,&rdquo; said tender-hearted Cecily tearfully.</p><p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand, so I carried him home and gave him just a little milk. Fortunately he was able to lap it. I gave him a little more at intervals all day, and when I left he was able to crawl around. I think he&rsquo;ll be all right, but you&rsquo;ll have to be careful how you feed him for a few days. Don&rsquo;t let your hearts run away with your judgment and kill him with kindness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
