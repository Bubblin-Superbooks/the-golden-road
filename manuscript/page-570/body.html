And I had a beautiful dream, Janet. I dreamed that the old orchard blossomed again, as it did that spring eighteen years ago. I dreamed that its sunshine was the sunshine of spring, not autumn. There was newness of life in my dream, Janet, and the sweetness of forgotten words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it strange about MY dream?&rdquo; whispered the Story Girl to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better come in and have some breakfast,&rdquo; said Aunt Janet. &ldquo;These are my little girls&mdash;Felicity and Cecily.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
