<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>FELIX KING.</p><p>BEAUTIFUL ALICE</p><p>That is what we girls call Miss Reade among ourselves. She is divinely beautiful. Her magnificent wealth of raven hair flows back in glistening waves from her sun-kissed brow. (DAN: &ldquo;If Felix had said she was sunburned you&rsquo;d have all jumped on him.&rdquo; (CECILY, COLDLY: &ldquo;Sun-kissed doesn&rsquo;t mean sunburned.&rdquo; DAN: &ldquo;What does it mean then?&rdquo; CECILY, EMBARRASSED: &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. But Miss Montague says the Lady Geraldine&rsquo;s brow was sun-kissed and of course an earl&rsquo;s daughter wouldn&rsquo;t be sunburned. &ldquo;THE STORY GIRL: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t interrupt the reading like this. It spoils it.&rdquo;) Her eyes are gloriously dark and deep, like midnight lakes mirroring the stars of heaven. Her features are like sculptured marble and her mouth is a trembling, curving Cupid&rsquo;s bow.</p></div> </div>
