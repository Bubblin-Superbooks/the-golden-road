<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They agreed to be married that winter, but Georgina couldn&rsquo;t set the day exactly because her brother, who lived in Ontario, was coming home for a visit, and she wanted to be married while he was home. So it was arranged that she was to write Uncle Andrew and tell him what day to come. She did, and she told him to come on a Tuesday. But her writing wasn&rsquo;t very good and poor Uncle Andrew thought she wrote Thursday. So on Thursday he drove all the way to Georgina&rsquo;s home to be married. It was forty miles and a bitter cold day. But it wasn&rsquo;t any colder than the reception he got from Georgina. She was out in the porch, with her head tied up in a towel, picking geese. She had been all ready Tuesday, and her friends and the minister were there, and the wedding supper prepared. But there was no bridegroom and Georgina was furious. Nothing Uncle Andrew could say would appease her.</p></div> </div>
