<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I&rsquo;ve tried every remedy I ever heard of, but nothing does any good. Judy Pineau said if I rubbed them with toad-spit it would take them away for sure. But how am I to get any toad-spit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a very nice remedy, anyhow,&rdquo; shuddered Cecily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have the warts. But do you know, I believe if you didn&rsquo;t cry so much over every little thing, you&rsquo;d be ever so much better looking. Crying spoils your eyes and makes the end of your nose red.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help crying,&rdquo; protested Sara. &ldquo;My feelings are so very sensitive. I&rsquo;ve given up trying to keep THAT resolution.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
