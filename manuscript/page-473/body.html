<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He was a young man then and he says he can never forget that dreadful time. You know in those days hundreds of American fishing schooners used to come down to the Gulf every summer to fish mackerel. On one beautiful Saturday night in this October of 1851, more than one hundred of these vessels could be counted from Markdale Capes. By Monday night more than seventy of them had been destroyed. Those which had escaped were mostly those which went into harbour Saturday night, to keep Sunday. Mr. Coles says the rest stayed outside and fished all day Sunday, same as through the week, and HE says the storm was a judgment on them for doing it. But he admits that even some of them got into harbour later on and escaped, so it&rsquo;s hard to know what to think. But it is certain that on Sunday night there came up a sudden and terrible storm&mdash;the worst, Mr. Coles says, that has ever been known on the north shore.</p></div> </div>
