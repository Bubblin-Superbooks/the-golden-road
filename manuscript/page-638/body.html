<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter for you from father,&rdquo; said Felix, tossing it to me as he came through the orchard gate. We had been picking apples all day, but were taking a mid-afternoon rest around the well, with a cup of its sparkling cold water to refresh us.</p><p>I opened the letter rather indifferently, for father, with all his excellent and lovable traits, was but a poor correspondent; his letters were usually very brief and very unimportant.</p><p>This letter was brief enough, but it was freighted with a message of weighty import. I sat gazing stupidly at the sheet after I had read it until Felix exclaimed,</p><p>&ldquo;Bev, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? What&rsquo;s in that letter?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
