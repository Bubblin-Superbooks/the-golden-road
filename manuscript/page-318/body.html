<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The wedding was a perennial source of conversation among us in those days; but presently its interest palled for a time in the light of another quite tremendous happening. One Saturday night Peter&rsquo;s mother called to take him home with her for Sunday. She had been working at Mr. James Frewen&rsquo;s, and Mr. Frewen was driving her home. We had never seen Peter&rsquo;s mother before, and we looked at her with discreet curiosity. She was a plump, black-eyed little woman, neat as a pin, but with a rather tired and care-worn face that looked as if it should have been rosy and jolly. Life had been a hard battle for her, and I rather think that her curly-headed little lad was all that had kept heart and spirit in her. Peter went home with her and returned Sunday evening.</p></div> </div>
