She didn&rsquo;t mean to bring me mucilage. It&rsquo;s really all my own fault, I know. I made a solemn vow when Peter was dying that I would never curl my hair again, and I should have kept it. It isn&rsquo;t right to break solemn vows. But my hair will look like dried hay tonight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
