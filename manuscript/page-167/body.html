<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Great-aunt Eliza? Nonsense,&rdquo; said Aunt Janet. &ldquo;Aunt Eliza was in town today. She had tea with us at Aunt Louisa&rsquo;s. But wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Governor Lesley here? We met her on her way back to Charlottetown and she told us she was. She said she was visiting a friend in Carlisle and thought she&rsquo;d call to see father for old acquaintance sake. What in the world are all you children staring like that for? Your eyes are like saucers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was a lady here to tea,&rdquo; said Felicity miserably, &ldquo;but we thought it was Great-aunt Eliza&mdash;she never SAID she wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;I thought she acted queer&mdash;and we all yelled at her as if she was deaf&mdash;and said things to each other about her nose&mdash;and Pat running over her clothes&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
