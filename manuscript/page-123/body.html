(DAN, INDIGNANTLY:&mdash;&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t. I only et one piece!&rdquo;)</p><p>Mr. Peter Craig thinks he saw the Family Ghost on Christmas Eve. But the rest of us think all he saw was the white calf with the red tail. (PETER, MUTTERING SULKILY:&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer calf that would walk up on end and wring its hands.&rdquo;)</p><p>Miss Cecily King spent the night of Dec. 20th with Miss Kitty Marr. They talked most of the night about new knitted lace patterns and their beaus and were very sleepy in school next day. (CECILY, SHARPLY:&mdash;&ldquo;We never mentioned such things!&rdquo;)</p></div> </div>
