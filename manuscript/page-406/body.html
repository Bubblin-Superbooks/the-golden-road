Chilled and terrified, she had made her way to her husband&rsquo;s door, only to be driven away brutally as a restless ghost by the horror-stricken inmates. A similar reception awaited her at her father&rsquo;s. Then she had wandered blindly through the streets of Florence until she had fallen exhausted at the door of the lover of her girlhood.
