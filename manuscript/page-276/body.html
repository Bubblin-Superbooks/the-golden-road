Do you mean to say you believe he wouldn&rsquo;t have come walking up our lane just when he did if she had never thought of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean to say that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if I had several wishbones of the same kind,&rdquo; retorted Peter stubbornly.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t think the wishbone had really anything to do with our getting Paddy back, but I&rsquo;m glad I tried it, for all that,&rdquo; remarked Cecily in a tone of satisfaction.</p></div> </div>
