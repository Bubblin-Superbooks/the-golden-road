But it is very impolite to open other people&rsquo;s letters. I think I have a better plan. Since you refuse to tell me who wrote it, open it yourself, take this chalk, and copy the contents on the blackboard that we may all enjoy them. And sign the writer&rsquo;s name at the bottom.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
