<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Cecily relapsed into anxious thought, and care sat visibly on her brow for the rest of the day. Next morning she came to me and said:</p><p>&ldquo;Bev, would you like to go for a walk with me this afternoon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Any particular where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Mr. Campbell and ask him for his name for my square,&rdquo; said Cecily resolutely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it will do any good. He wouldn&rsquo;t give anything to the library last summer, you remember, till the Story Girl told him that story about his grandmother. She won&rsquo;t go with me this time&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why. I can&rsquo;t tell a story and I&rsquo;m frightened to death just to think of going to him. But I believe it is my duty; and besides I would love to get as many names on my square as Kitty Marr has.</p></div> </div>
