<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He had lived all his life in Carlisle; and all the Carlisle people knew of or about him&mdash;although they thought they knew everything&mdash;was that he was painfully, abnormally shy. He never went anywhere except to church; he never took part in Carlisle&rsquo;s simple social life; even with most men he was distant and reserved; as for women, he never spoke to or looked at them; if one spoke to him, even if she were a matronly old mother in Israel, he was at once in an agony of painful blushes. He had no friends in the sense of companions; to all outward appearance his life was solitary and devoid of any human interest.</p><p>He had no housekeeper; but his old house, furnished as it had been in his mother&rsquo;s lifetime, was cleanly and daintily kept.</p></div> </div>
