But now that I think of it&mdash;Uncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in Halifax last summer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If she does get married you&rsquo;ll have to come and live with us,&rdquo; said Cecily delightedly.</p><p>Felicity did not betray so much delight and the Story Girl remarked with a weary little sigh that she hoped Aunt Olivia wouldn&rsquo;t. We all felt rather weary, somehow. Peg&rsquo;s predictions had been unsettling, and our nerves had all been more or less strained during our sojourn under her roof. We were glad when we found ourselves at home.</p></div> </div>
