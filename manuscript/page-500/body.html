The Story Girl wore her school print dress and hat also, and was gloveless and heavy shod.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have to go through this all alone, Cecily,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t be half so hard now,&rdquo; said Cecily, with a long breath of relief.</p><p>I fancy it was hard enough even then. The Story Girl did not care a whit, but Cecily rather squirmed under the curious glances that were cast at her. She afterwards told me that she really did not think she could have endured it if she had been alone.</p></div> </div>
