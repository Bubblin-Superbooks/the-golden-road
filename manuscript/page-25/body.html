What am I to do if nobody asks any?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must make some up,&rdquo; said the Story Girl. &ldquo;Uncle Roger says that is what the Family Guide man does. He says it is impossible that there can be as many hopeless fools in the world as that column would stand for otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We want you to edit the household department, Felicity,&rdquo; I said, seeing a cloud lowering on that fair lady&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Nobody can do that as well as you. Felix will edit the jokes and the Information Bureau, and Cecily must be fashion editor.</p></div> </div>
