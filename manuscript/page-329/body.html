<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Peter was not the only one who had secret cares. Sara Ray was beginning to feel worried over her looks. I heard her and Cecily talking over their troubles one evening while I was weeding the onion bed and they were behind the hedge knitting lace. I did not mean to eavesdrop. I supposed they knew I was there until Cecily overwhelmed me with indignation later on.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so afraid, Cecily, that I&rsquo;m going to be homely all my life,&rdquo; said poor Sara with a tremble in her voice. &ldquo;You can stand being ugly when you are young if you have any hope of being better looking when you grow up. But I&rsquo;m getting worse. Aunt Mary says I&rsquo;m going to be the very image of Aunt Matilda. And Aunt Matilda is as homely as she can be. It isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;and poor Sara sighed&mdash;&ldquo;a very cheerful prospect.</p></div> </div>
