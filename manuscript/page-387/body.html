<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Humph! And your hands?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Warts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;ll take them away. You get a pertater and go out under the full moon, cut the pertater in two, rub your warts with one half and say, &lsquo;One, two, three, warts, go away from me.&rsquo; Then rub them with the other half and say, &lsquo;One, two, three, four, warts, never trouble me more.&rsquo; Then bury the pertater and never tell a living soul where you buried it. You won&rsquo;t have no more warts. Mind you bury the pertater, though. If you don&rsquo;t, and anyone picks it up, she&rsquo;ll get your warts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
