<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I did wish she hadn&rsquo;t said anything about the dog because I mightn&rsquo;t of thought about it if she hadn&rsquo;t. I had to go on alone thinking of it. I&rsquo;d heard the story often but I&rsquo;d never believed in it. They said the dog used to appear at one end of the bridge and walk across it with people and vanish when he got to the other end. He never tried to bite anyone but one wouldn&rsquo;t want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didn&rsquo;t believe in him. I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a paraphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School lesson but oh, how my heart beat when I got near the hollow! It was so dark. You could just see things dim-like but you couldn&rsquo;t see what they were. When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to the railing so I couldn&rsquo;t think the dog was behind me.</p></div> </div>
