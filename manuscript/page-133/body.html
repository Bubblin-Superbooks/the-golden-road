<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a diamond winter day in February&mdash;clear, cold, hard, brilliant. The sharp blue sky shone, the white fields and hills glittered, the fringe of icicles around the eaves of Uncle Alec&rsquo;s house sparkled. Keen was the frost and crisp the snow over our world; and we young fry of the King households were all agog to enjoy life&mdash;for was it not Saturday, and were we not left all alone to keep house?</p><p>Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia had had their last big &ldquo;kill&rdquo; of market poultry the day before; and early in the morning all our grown-ups set forth to Charlottetown, to be gone the whole day. They left us many charges as usual, some of which we remembered and some of which we forgot; but with Felicity in command none of us dared stray far out of line.</p></div> </div>
