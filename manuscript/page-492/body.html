We ARE in earnest, Mr. Campbell&mdash;indeed we are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Campbell impolitely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do things that are nice and interesting. You&rsquo;ll get up concerts, and chase people about for autographs and give money your parents give you and that doesn&rsquo;t cost you either time or labour. But you wouldn&rsquo;t do anything you disliked for the heathen children&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t make any real sacrifice for them&mdash;catch you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
