<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When Mr. Davidson went to church next Sunday he put the hat on without ever looking into the crown. He walked to church in a brown study and at the door he took off his hat. The nightcap just slipped down on his head, as if it had been put on, and the frill stood out around his face and the string hung down his back. But he never noticed it, because his thoughts were far away, and he walked up the church aisle and into the pulpit, like that. One of his elders had to tiptoe up and tell him what he had on his head. He plucked it off in a dazed fashion, held it up, and looked at it. &lsquo;Bless me, it is Sally&rsquo;s nightcap!&rsquo; he exclaimed mildly. &lsquo;I do not know how I could have got it on.&rsquo; Then he just stuffed it into his pocket calmly and went on with the service, and the long strings of the nightcap hung down out of his pocket all the time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
