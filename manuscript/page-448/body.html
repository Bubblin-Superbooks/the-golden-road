But Uncle Roger says the supply in Mr. Marwood&rsquo;s vacation never amounts to much. I know an awfully funny story about old Mr. Davidson. He used to be the minister in Baywater, you know, and he had a large family and his children were very mischievous. One day his wife was ironing and she ironed a great big nightcap with a frill round it. One of the children took it when she wasn&rsquo;t looking and hid it in his father&rsquo;s best beaver hat&mdash;the one he wore on Sundays.</p></div> </div>
