Gossip had it that he changed colour. We wretched occupants of the King pew were concerned only with our own outraged feelings.</p><p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Melita Ross,&rdquo; went on Peg. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the same bonnet on she had last time I was in Carlisle church six years ago. Some folks has the knack of making things last. But look at the style Mrs. Elmer Brewer wears, will yez? Yez wouldn&rsquo;t think her mother died in the poor-house, would yez, now?&rdquo;</p><p>Poor Mrs. Brewer! From the tip of her smart kid shoes to the dainty cluster of ostrich tips in her bonnet&mdash;she was most immaculately and handsomely arrayed; but I venture to think she could have taken small pleasure in her fashionable attire that evening.</p></div> </div>
