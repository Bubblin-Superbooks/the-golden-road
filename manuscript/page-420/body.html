<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;So have I. But it isn&rsquo;t fear. I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I feel as if something was reaching out of the graveyard to hold me&mdash;something that wanted life&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;let&rsquo;s hurry. But isn&rsquo;t it strange to think of all the dead people in there who were once alive like you and me. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could EVER die. Do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but everybody must. Of course we go on living afterwards, just the same. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of such things here,&rdquo; I said hurriedly.</p><p>When we reached the school I contrived to open a window. We scrambled in, lighted a lamp and found the missing necklace.</p></div> </div>
