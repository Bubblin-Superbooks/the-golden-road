We are good comrades, those ghosts and I; we walk and talk&mdash;we even laugh together&mdash;sorrowful laughter that has sorrow&rsquo;s own sweetness. And always there comes to me one dear phantom and wanders hand in hand with me&mdash;a lost lady of the old years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mother?&rdquo; said the Story Girl very softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your mother. Here, in her old haunts, it is impossible for me to believe that she can be dead&mdash;that her LAUGHTER can be dead. She was the gayest, sweetest thing&mdash;and so young&mdash;only three years older than you, Sara. Yonder old house had been glad because of her for eighteen years when I met her first.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
