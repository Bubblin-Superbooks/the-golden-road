My most exciting adventure happened a year ago last November. I was nearly frightened to death. Dan says he wouldn&rsquo;t of been scared and Felicity says she would of known what it was but it&rsquo;s easy to talk.</p><p>It happened the night I went down to see Kitty Marr. I thought when I went that Aunt Olivia was visiting there and I could come home with her. But she wasn&rsquo;t there and I had to come home alone. Kitty came a piece of the way but she wouldn&rsquo;t come any further than Uncle James Frewen&rsquo;s gate. She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would get the tooth-ache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of the dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James&rsquo; hollow.</p></div> </div>
