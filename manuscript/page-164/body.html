Don&rsquo;t you do such a thing,&rdquo; said Felicity contemptuously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d think you were crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was awfully nice when I asked her for her name for the quilt,&rdquo; protested Cecily, &ldquo;and she took a ten-cent section after all. So I&rsquo;d like to give her the rose-leaves&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to, too, Miss Felicity.&rdquo;</p><p>Great-aunt Eliza accepted the little gift quite graciously, bade us all good-bye, said she had enjoyed herself very much, left messages for father and mother, and finally betook herself away. We watched her cross the yard, tall, stately, erect, and disappear down the lane.</p></div> </div>
