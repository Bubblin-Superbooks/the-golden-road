<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The personal column was well looked after by Miss Sara Stanley and the story page has been a marked success under the able management of Mr. Peter Craig, to whose original story in this issue, &ldquo;The Battle of the Partridge Eggs,&rdquo; we would call especial attention. The Exciting Adventure series has also been very popular.</p><p>And now, in closing, we bid farewell to our staff and thank them one and all for their help and co-operation in the past year. We have enjoyed our work and we trust that they have too. We wish them all happiness and success in years to come, and we hope that the recollection of Our Magazine will not be held least dear among the memories of their childhood.</p></div> </div>
