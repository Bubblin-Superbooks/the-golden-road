She had to be honest, but she would rather not have complimented Felicity. &ldquo;And you needn&rsquo;t laugh at Bev. His stripes are beautiful. It isn&rsquo;t HE that is striped. It&rsquo;s just the THOUGHT of him. Peg Bowen is a queer sort of yellowish green and the Awkward Man is lilac. Aunt Olivia is pansy-purple mixed with gold, and Uncle Roger is navy blue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never heard such nonsense,&rdquo; declared Felicity. The rest of us were rather inclined to agree with her for once. We thought the Story Girl was making fun of us. But I believe she really had a strange gift of thinking in colours.</p></div> </div>
