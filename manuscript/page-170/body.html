<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I had just a splendid time at your place, and I envy your Aunt Eliza her nephews and nieces. You were all so nice to me, and I didn&rsquo;t dare to be a bit nice to you lest I should give myself away. But I&rsquo;ll make up for that when you come to see me at Government House, as you all must the very next time you come to town. I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t see Paddy, for I love pussy cats, even if they do track molasses over my clothes. And, Cecily, thank you ever so much for that little bag of pot-pourri. It smells like a hundred rose gardens, and I have put it between the sheets for my very sparest room bed, where you shall sleep when you come to see me, you dear thing. And the Governor wants you to put his name on the quilt square, too, in the ten-cent section.</p></div> </div>
