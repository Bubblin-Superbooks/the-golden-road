I was brought up to believe that a hole was an accident but a patch was a disgrace. And so your Aunt Olivia is going to be married after all?&rdquo;</p><p>This was news to us. We felt and looked dazed.</p><p>&ldquo;I never heard anything of it,&rdquo; said the Story Girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s true enough. She&rsquo;s a great fool. I&rsquo;ve no faith in husbands. But one good thing is she ain&rsquo;t going to marry that Henry Jacobs of Markdale. He wants her bad enough. Just like his presumption,&mdash;thinking himself good enough for a King. His father is the worst man alive. He chased me off his place with his dog once. But I&rsquo;ll get even with him yet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
