It was, &ldquo;Hold your tongue when you can, and when you can&rsquo;t tell the truth.&rdquo; Cecily feels she has not read all the good books she might, because some she tried to read were very dull and the Pansy books were so much more interesting.

Dan refuses to say anything about his resolutions and so does the editor.</p><p>PERSONALS</p></div> </div>
