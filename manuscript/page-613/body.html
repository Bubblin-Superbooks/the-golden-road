<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sketch it,&rdquo; said Uncle Blair.</p><p>While he sketched it the Story Girl and I sat on the banks of the brook and she told me the story of the Sighing Reed. It was a very simple little story, that of the slender brown reed which grew by the forest pool and always was sad and sighing because it could not utter music like the brook and the birds and the winds. All the bright, beautiful things around it mocked it and laughed at it for its folly. Who would ever look for music in it, a plain, brown, unbeautiful thing? But one day a youth came through the wood; he was as beautiful as the spring; he cut the brown reed and fashioned it according to his liking; and then he put it to his lips and breathed on it; and, oh, the music that floated through the forest! It was so entrancing that everything&mdash;brooks and birds and winds&mdash;grew silent to listen to it.</p></div> </div>
