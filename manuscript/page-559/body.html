<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It happened that the Story Girl and I both got up very early on the morning of the Awkward Man&rsquo;s wedding day. Uncle Alec was going to Charlottetown that day, and I, awakened at daybreak by the sounds in the kitchen beneath us, remembered that I had forgotten to ask him to bring me a certain school-book I wanted. So I hurriedly dressed and hastened down to tell him before he went. I was joined on the stairs by the Story Girl, who said she had wakened and, not feeling like going to sleep again, thought she might as well get up.</p><p>&ldquo;I had such a funny dream last night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I dreamed that I heard a voice calling me from away down in Uncle Stephen&rsquo;s Walk&mdash;&lsquo;Sara, Sara, Sara,&rsquo; it kept calling. I didn&rsquo;t know whose it was, and yet it seemed like a voice I knew.</p></div> </div>
