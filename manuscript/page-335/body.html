I haven&rsquo;t enough spunk,&rdquo; confessed Cecily with a blush. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I did do once. He wrote me a long letter last week. It was just awfully SOFT, and every other word was spelled wrong. He even spelled baking soda, &lsquo;bacon soda!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth had he to say about baking soda in a love-letter?&rdquo; asked Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he said his mother sent him to the store for some and he forgot it because he was thinking about me. Well, I just took his letter and wrote in all the words, spelled right, above the wrong ones, in red ink, just as Mr. Perkins makes us do with our dictation exercises, and sent it back to him. I thought maybe he&rsquo;d feel insulted and stop writing to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
