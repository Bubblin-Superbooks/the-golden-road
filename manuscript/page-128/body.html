It is nice to have one the same colour as your cap.</p><p>Red mittens with a black diamond pattern on the back are much run after. Em Frewen&rsquo;s grandma knits hers for her. She can knit the double diamond pattern and Em puts on such airs about it, but I think the single diamond is in better taste.</p><p>The new winter hats at Markdale are very pretty. It is so exciting to pick a hat. Boys can&rsquo;t have that fun. Their hats are so much alike.</p></div> </div>
