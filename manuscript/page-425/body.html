<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This was a story my Aunt Jane told me about her granma when she was a little girl. Its funny to think of baking a locket, but it wasn&rsquo;t to eat. She was my great granma but Ill call her granma for short. It happened when she was ten years old. Of course she wasent anybodys granma then. Her father and mother and her were living in a new settlement called Brinsley. Their nearest naybor was a mile away. One day her Aunt Hannah from Charlottetown came and wanted her ma to go visiting with her. At first granma&rsquo;s ma thought she couldent go because it was baking day and granma&rsquo;s pa was away. But granma wasent afraid to stay alone and she knew how to bake the bread so she made her ma go and her Aunt Hannah took off the handsome gold locket and chain she was waring round her neck and hung it on granmas and told her she could ware it all day. Granma was awful pleased for she had never had any jewelry.</p></div> </div>
