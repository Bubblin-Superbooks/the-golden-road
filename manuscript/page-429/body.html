It was an awful one. I had a striped ribbon, striped brown and yellow and I LOST IT. I was very sorry for it was a handsome ribbon and all the girls in school were jealous of it. (FELICITY: &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t think it one bit pretty.&rdquo; CECILY: &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;) I hunted everywhere but I couldn&rsquo;t find it. Next day was Sunday and I was running into the house by the front door and I saw SOMETHING LYING ON THE STEP and I thought it was my ribbon and I made a grab at it as I passed. But, oh, it was A SNAKE! Oh, I can never describe how I felt when I felt that awful thing WRIGGLING IN MY HAND.</p></div> </div>
