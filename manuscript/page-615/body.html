<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There is magic in the scent of dying fir,&rdquo; Uncle Blair was saying aloud to himself, as if forgetting he was not quite alone. &ldquo;It gets into our blood like some rare, subtly-compounded wine, and thrills us with unutterable sweetnesses, as of recollections from some other fairer life, lived in some happier star. Compared to it, all other scents seem heavy and earth-born, luring to the valleys instead of the heights. But the tang of the fir summons onward and upward to some &lsquo;far-off, divine event&rsquo;&mdash;some spiritual peak of attainment whence we shall see with unfaltering, unclouded vision the spires of some aerial City Beautiful, or the fulfilment of some fair, fadeless land of promise.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
