<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The dew and heat will take all the curl out of yours and then you&rsquo;ll look like a scarecrow,&rdquo; warned Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to put my hair up in paper tonight and wet it with a curling-fluid that Judy Pineau uses. Sara brought me up a bottle of it. Judy says it is great stuff&mdash;your hair will keep in curl for days, no matter how damp the weather is. I&rsquo;ll leave my hair in the papers till tomorrow evening, and then I&rsquo;ll have beautiful curls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better leave your hair alone,&rdquo; said Dan gruffly. &ldquo;Smooth hair is better than a lot of fly-away curls.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
