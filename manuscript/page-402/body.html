<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My name is Norval; on the Grampian hills My father feeds his flocks.&rdquo;</p><p>At our first practice Peter had started gaily in, rushing through the first line with no thought whatever of punctuation&mdash;&ldquo;My name is Norval on the Grampian Hills.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop, stop, Peter,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Perkins, sarcastically, &ldquo;your name might be Norval if you were never on the Grampian Hills. There&rsquo;s a semi-colon in that line, I wish you to remember.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter did remember it. Cecily neither fainted nor failed when it came her turn. She recited her little piece very well, though somewhat mechanically. I think she really did much better than if she had had her desired curls. The miserable conviction that her hair, alone among that glossy-tressed bevy, was looking badly, quite blotted out all nervousness and self-consciousness from her mind.</p></div> </div>
