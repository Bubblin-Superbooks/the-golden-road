Who do you suppose told me the story&mdash;no, read it to me, out of his brown book?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never the Awkward Man himself!&rdquo; I exclaimed incredulously.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; said the Story Girl triumphantly. &ldquo;I met him one day last week back in the maple woods when I was looking for ferns. He was sitting by the spring, writing in his brown book. He hid it when he saw me and looked real silly; but after I had talked to him awhile I just asked him about it, and told him that the gossips said he wrote poetry in it, and if he did would he tell me, because I was dying to know. He said he wrote a little of everything in it; and then I begged him to read me something out of it, and he read me the story of Ursula and Kenneth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
