<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Come, and you&rsquo;ll have a ramble and an afternoon that you will both remember all your lives.&rdquo;</p><p>We did have it; never has its remembrance faded; that idyllic afternoon of roving in the old Carlisle woods with the Story Girl and Uncle Blair gleams in my book of years, a page of living beauty. Yet it was but a few hours of simplest pleasure; we wandered pathlessly through the sylvan calm of those dear places which seemed that day to be full of a great friendliness; Uncle Blair sauntered along behind us, whistling softly; sometimes he talked to himself; we delighted in those brief reveries of his; Uncle Blair was the only man I have ever known who could, when he so willed, &ldquo;talk like a book,&rdquo; and do it without seeming ridiculous; perhaps it was because he had the knack of choosing &ldquo;fit audience, though few,&rdquo; and the proper time to appeal to that audience.</p></div> </div>
