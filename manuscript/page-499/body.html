I WON&rsquo;T sit with you. There will be so many strangers there, and all the Markdale people, and what will they think of you? Some of them will never know the reason, either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish the Story Girl would hurry,&rdquo; was all poor Cecily said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be late. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been quite so hard if I could have got there before anyone and slipped quietly into our pew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here she comes at last,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;Why&mdash;what&rsquo;s she got on?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
