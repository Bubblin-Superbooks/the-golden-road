<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter with Cecily?&rdquo; demanded Dan. &ldquo;Is she sick?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t. I warned her not to put her hair in curls but she wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me. I guess she wishes she had now. When people haven&rsquo;t natural curly hair they shouldn&rsquo;t try to make it curly. They get punished if they do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, Felicity, never mind all that. Just tell us what has happened Sis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this is what has happened her. That ninny of a Sara Ray brought up a bottle of mucilage instead of Judy&rsquo;s curling-fluid, and Cecily put her hair up with THAT. It&rsquo;s in an awful state.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
