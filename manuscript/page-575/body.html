We knew the Awkward Man and his bride were expected home at sunset, and we meant to scatter flowers on the path by which she must enter her new home. It was the Story Girl&rsquo;s idea, but I don&rsquo;t think Aunt Janet would have let us go if Uncle Blair had not pleaded for us. He asked to be taken along, too, and we agreed, if he would stand out of sight when the newly married pair came home.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, father, the Awkward Man won&rsquo;t mind us, because we&rsquo;re only children and he knows us well,&rdquo; explained the Story Girl, &ldquo;but if he sees you, a stranger, it might confuse him and we might spoil the homecoming, and that would be such a pity.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
