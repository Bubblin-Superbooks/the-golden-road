So it was a good half-hour before Ursula said,</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Kenneth, I cannot stay long&mdash;I shall be missed. You said in your letter that you had something important to talk of. What is it?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My news is this, Ursula. Next Saturday morning my vessel, The Fair Lady, with her captain on board, sails at dawn from Charlottetown harbour, bound for Buenos Ayres. At this season this means a safe and sure return&mdash;next May.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kenneth!&rsquo; cried Ursula. She turned pale and burst into tears. &lsquo;How can you think of leaving me? Oh, you are cruel!&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
