He was only a cat, but he had been our faithful friend for a long time and we aren&rsquo;t ashamed to be sorry for him. There are lots of people who are not as friendly and gentlemanly as Paddy was, and he was a great mouser. We buried all that was mortal of poor Pat in the orchard and we are never going to forget him. We have resolved that whenever the date of his death comes round we&rsquo;ll bow our heads and pronounce his name at the hour of his funeral. If we are anywhere where we can&rsquo;t say the name out loud we&rsquo;ll whisper it.</p></div> </div>
