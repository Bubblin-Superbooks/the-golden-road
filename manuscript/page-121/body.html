<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And then just in the middle of the bridge I met something. It was right before me and it was big and black, just about the size of a Newfoundland dog, and I thought I could see a white nose. And it kept jumping about from one side of the bridge to the other. Oh, I hope none of my readers will ever be so frightened as I was then. I was too frightened to run back because I was afraid it would chase me and I couldn&rsquo;t get past it, it moved so quick, and then it just made one spring right on me and I felt its claws and I screamed and fell down. It rolled off to one side and laid there quite quiet but I didn&rsquo;t dare move and I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of me if Amos Cowan hadn&rsquo;t come along that very minute with a lantern. And there was me sitting in the middle of the bridge and that awful thing beside me.</p></div> </div>
