<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We all stopped and huddled together in a miserable group. Fear filled our hearts. It seemed ages ago that we had been snug and safe and warm at Cousin Mattie&rsquo;s. Cecily began to cry with cold. Dan, in spite of her protests, dragged off his overcoat and made her put it on.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all freeze to death if we do. Come on&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to keep moving. The snow ain&rsquo;t so deep yet. Take hold of my hand, Cecily. We must all hold together. Come, now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be nice to be frozen to death, but if we get through alive think what a story we&rsquo;ll have to tell,&rdquo; said the Story Girl between her chattering teeth.</p></div> </div>
