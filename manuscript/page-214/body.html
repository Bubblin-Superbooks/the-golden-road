We were dreadfully frightened, for we knew there were times when she was quite crazy and we feared one of her &ldquo;spells&rdquo; was coming on her. But with a swift movement she turned the man&rsquo;s coat she wore up over her shoulders and head like a hood, completely hiding her face. Then she crouched forward, elbows on knees, and relapsed into silence. None of us dared speak or move. We sat thus for half an hour. Then Peg jumped up and said briskly in her usual tone,</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess yez are all sleepy and ready for bed. You girls can sleep in my bed over there, and I&rsquo;ll take the sofy. Yez can put the cat off if yez like, though he won&rsquo;t hurt yez. You boys can go downstairs. There&rsquo;s a big pile of straw there that&rsquo;ll do yez for a bed, if yez put your coats on.</p></div> </div>
