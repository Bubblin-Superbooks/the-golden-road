<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day in school Cyrus sent a letter across to Cecily. Usually he left his effusions in her desk, or between the leaves of her books; but this time it was passed over to her under cover of the desk through the hands of two or three scholars. Just as Em Frewen held it over the aisle Mr. Perkins wheeled around from his station before the blackboard and caught her in the act.</p><p>&ldquo;Bring that here, Emmeline,&rdquo; he commanded.</p><p>Cyrus turned quite pale. Em carried the note to Mr. Perkins. He took it, held it up, and scrutinized the address.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you write this to Cecily, Emmeline?&rdquo; he asked.</p></div> </div>
