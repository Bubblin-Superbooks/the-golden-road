<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I can dream that I tell you my love; that&mdash;maddest, sweetest dream of all&mdash;that you love me in return. Everything is possible in dreams, you know, dear. My dreams are all I have, so I go far in them, even to dreaming that you are my wife. I dream how I shall fix up my dull old house for you. One room will need nothing more&mdash;it is your room, dear, and has been ready for you a long time&mdash;long before that day I saw you under the pine. Your books and your chair and your picture are there, dear&mdash;only the picture is not half lovely enough. But the other rooms of the house must be made to bloom out freshly for you. What a delight it is thus to dream of what I would do for you! Then I would bring you home, dear, and lead you through my garden and into my house as its mistress.</p></div> </div>
