I says, solemn-like, &lsquo;Dad, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve got to tell you, and I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll take it, but it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rsquo; I says. Dad looked pretty sober, and he says, says he, &lsquo;What have you been up to, Peter? Don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me. I&rsquo;ve been forgiven to seventy times seven, so surely I can forgive a little, too?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says, desperate-like, &lsquo;the truth is, father, I&rsquo;m a Presbyterian. I made up my mind last summer, the time of the Judgment Day, that I&rsquo;d be a Presbyterian, and I&rsquo;ve got to stick to it.</p></div> </div>
