<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No, they went to town today. But they&rsquo;ll be home this evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they&rsquo;re away,&rdquo; said Aunt Eliza, coming in, &ldquo;because I can stay only a few hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; shouted poor Felicity, darting an angry glance at the rest of us, as if to demand why we didn&rsquo;t help her out. &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve been thinking you&rsquo;d stay a week with us anyway. You MUST stay over Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t. I have to go to Charlottetown tonight,&rdquo; returned Aunt Eliza.</p></div> </div>
