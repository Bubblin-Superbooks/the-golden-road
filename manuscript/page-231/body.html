<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We regret that Miss Cecily King is suffering from a severe cold.</p><p>Mr. Alexander Marr of Markdale died very suddenly last week. We never heard of his death till he was dead.</p><p>Miss Cecily King wishes to state that she did not ask the question about &ldquo;Holy Moses&rdquo; and the other word in the January number. Dan put it in for a mean joke.</p><p>The weather has been cold and fine. We have only had one bad storm. The coasting on Uncle Roger&rsquo;s hill continues good.</p><p>Aunt Eliza did not favour us with a visit after all. She took cold and had to go home. We were sorry that she had a cold but glad that she had to go home. Cecily said she thought it wicked of us to be glad. But when we asked her &ldquo;cross her heart&rdquo; if she wasn&rsquo;t glad herself she had to say she was.</p></div> </div>
