<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How dare you? You have spied on me&mdash;you have crept in and listened! How dare you? Do you know what you have done, girl? You have destroyed all that made life worth while to me. My dream is dead. It could not live when it was betrayed. And it was all I had. Oh, laugh at me&mdash;mock me! I know that I am ridiculous! What of it? It never could have hurt you! Why must you creep in like this to hear me and put me to shame? Oh, I love you&mdash;I will say it, laugh as you will. Is it such a strange thing that I should have a heart like other men? This will make sport for you! I, who love you better than my life, better than any other man in the world can love you, will be a jest to you all your life. I love you&mdash;and yet I think I could hate you&mdash;you have destroyed my dream&mdash;you have done me deadly wrong.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
