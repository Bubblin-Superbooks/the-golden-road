<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everything is in this hour&mdash;the beauty of classic myths, the primal charm of the silent and the open, the lure of mystery. Why, it&rsquo;s a time and place when and where everything might come true&mdash;when the men in green might creep out to join hands and dance around the fire, or dryads steal from their trees to warm their white limbs, grown chilly in October frosts, by the blaze. I wouldn&rsquo;t be much surprised if we should see something of the kind. Isn&rsquo;t that the flash of an ivory shoulder through yonder gloom? And didn&rsquo;t you see a queer little elfin face peering at us around that twisted gray trunk? But one can&rsquo;t be sure. Mortal eyesight is too slow and clumsy a thing to match against the flicker of a pixy-litten fire.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
