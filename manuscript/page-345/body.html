<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This rape of the lock did not produce quite such terrible consequences as the more famous one in Pope&rsquo;s poem, but Cecily&rsquo;s soul was no less agitated than Belinda&rsquo;s. She cried all the way home from school about it, and only checked her tears when Dan declared he&rsquo;d fight Cyrus and make him give it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, You mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; said Cecily, struggling with her sobs. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you fighting on my account for anything. And besides, he&rsquo;d likely lick you&mdash;he&rsquo;s so big and rough. And the folks at home might find out all about it, and Uncle Roger would never give me any peace, and mother would be cross, for she&rsquo;d never believe it wasn&rsquo;t my fault.
