In those days it was thought rather coarse for a young lady to have too hearty an appetite, and she was more admired if she was delicate about what she ate. Cousin Annetta set out to be very refined indeed. She pretended to have no appetite at all. One afternoon she was invited to tea at Grandfather King&rsquo;s when they had some special company&mdash;people from Charlottetown. Cousin Annetta said she could hardly eat anything.</p></div> </div>
