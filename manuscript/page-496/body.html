<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Campbell took us all over his barns and was very affable. He had beautiful horses, cows and sheep, and I enjoyed seeing them. I don&rsquo;t think Cecily did, however. She was very quiet and even Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s handsome new span of dappled grays failed to arouse any enthusiasm in her. She was already in bitter anticipation living over the martyrdom of the morrow. On the way home she asked me seriously if I thought Mr. Campbell would go to heaven when he died.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course he will,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a member of the church?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but I can&rsquo;t imagine him fitting into heaven. You know he isn&rsquo;t really fond of anything but live stock.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
