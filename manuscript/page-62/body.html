I&rsquo;m prouder of it than of anything else I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re welcome to it,&rdquo; said Felicity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand and I don&rsquo;t want to. I wouldn&rsquo;t give anybody a Christmas present that wasn&rsquo;t new, and I wouldn&rsquo;t thank anybody who gave me one.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was in the seventh heaven because Felicity had given him a present&mdash;and, moreover, one that she had made herself. It was a bookmark of perforated cardboard, with a gorgeous red and yellow worsted goblet worked on it, and below, in green letters, the solemn warning, &ldquo;Touch Not The Cup.&rdquo; As Peter was not addicted to habits of intemperance, not even to looking on dandelion wine when it was pale yellow, we did not exactly see why Felicity should have selected such a device.</p></div> </div>
