<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> (PETER, ASIDE: &ldquo;What kind of a thing is that?&rdquo;) Her creamy skin is as fair and flawless as the petals of a white lily. Her voice is like the ripple of a woodland brook and her slender form is matchless in its symmetry. (DAN: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Valeria&rsquo;s way of putting it, but Uncle Roger says she don&rsquo;t show her feed much.&rdquo; FELICITY: &ldquo;Dan! if Uncle Roger is vulgar you needn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;) Her hands are like a poet&rsquo;s dreams. She dresses so nicely and looks so stylish in her clothes. Her favourite colour is blue. Some people think she is stiff and some say she is stuck-up, but she isn&rsquo;t a bit. It&rsquo;s just that she is different from them and they don&rsquo;t like it. She is just lovely and we adore her.)</p></div> </div>
