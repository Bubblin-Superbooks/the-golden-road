<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Jasper! Jasper!&rdquo; cried Alice, finding her voice. His anger hurt her with a pain she could not endure. It was unbearable that Jasper should be angry with her. In that moment she realized that she loved him&mdash;that the words he had spoken when unconscious of her presence were the sweetest she had ever heard, or ever could hear. Nothing mattered at all, save that he loved her and was angry with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such dreadful things to me,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I did not mean to listen. I could not help it. I shall never laugh at you. Oh, Jasper&rdquo;&mdash;she looked bravely at him and the fine soul of her shone through the flesh like an illuminating lamp&mdash;&ldquo;I am glad that you love me! and I am glad I chanced to overhear you, since you would never have had the courage to tell me otherwise. Glad&mdash;glad! Do you understand, Jasper?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
