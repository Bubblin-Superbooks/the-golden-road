<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the gay preparations for Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s mid-June wedding, the excitement of practising for the concert with which our school-teacher, Mr. Perkins, had elected to close the school year, and Cecily&rsquo;s troubles with Cyrus Brisk, which furnished unholy mirth for the rest of us, though Cecily could not see the funny side of it at all.</p><p>Matters went from bad to worse in the case of the irrepressible Cyrus. He continued to shower Cecily with notes, the spelling of which showed no improvement; he worried the life out of her by constantly threatening to fight Willy Fraser&mdash;although, as Felicity sarcastically pointed out, he never did it.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m always afraid he will,&rdquo; said Cecily, &ldquo;and it would be such a DISGRACE to have two boys fighting over me in school.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
