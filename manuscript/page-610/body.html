<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A brook,&rdquo; quoth Uncle Blair, &ldquo;is the most changeful, bewitching, lovable thing in the world. It is never in the same mind or mood two minutes. Here it is sighing and murmuring as if its heart were broken. But listen&mdash;yonder by the birches it is laughing as if it were enjoying some capital joke all by itself.&rdquo;</p><p>It was indeed a changeful brook; here it would make a pool, dark and brooding and still, where we bent to look at our mirrored faces; then it grew communicative and gossiped shallowly over a broken pebble bed where there was a diamond dance of sunbeams and no troutling or minnow could glide through without being seen. Sometimes its banks were high and steep, hung with slender ashes and birches; again they were mere, low margins, green with delicate mosses, shelving out of the wood.</p></div> </div>
