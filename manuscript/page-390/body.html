<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At the end of June our school concert came off and was a great event in our young lives. It was the first appearance of most of us on any platform, and some of us were very nervous. We all had recitations, except Dan, who had refused flatly to take any part and was consequently care-free.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall die when I find myself up on that platform, facing people,&rdquo; sighed Sara Ray, as we talked the affair over in Uncle Stephen&rsquo;s Walk the night before the concert.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll faint,&rdquo; was Cecily&rsquo;s more moderate foreboding.</p></div> </div>
