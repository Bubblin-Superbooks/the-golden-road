It&rsquo;s Felicity. What on earth is that at the bottom of your basket, Cecily?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a History of the Reformation in France,&rdquo; confessed poor Cecily, &ldquo;by a man named D-a-u-b-i-g-n-y. I can&rsquo;t pronounce it. I heard Mr. Marwood saying it was a book everyone ought to read, so I began it last Sunday. I brought it along today to read when I got tired picking flowers. I&rsquo;d ever so much rather have brought Ester Reid. There&rsquo;s so much in the history I can&rsquo;t understand, and it is so dreadful to read of people being burned to death. But I felt I OUGHT to read it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
