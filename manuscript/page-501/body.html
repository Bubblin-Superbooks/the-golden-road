That was what I meant. I suppose you think you&rsquo;ve cheated me nicely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; spoke up the Story Girl undauntedly. &ldquo;She was all dressed and ready to come before she knew I was going to dress the same way. So she kept her bargain faithfully, Mr. Campbell, and I think you were cruel to make her do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do, eh? Well, well, I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me. I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d do it&mdash;I was sure feminine vanity would win the day over missionary zeal. It seems it didn&rsquo;t&mdash;though how much was pure missionary zeal and how much just plain King spunk I&rsquo;m doubtful.</p></div> </div>
