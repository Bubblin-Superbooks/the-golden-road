<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That evening the Story Girl and I drove the cows to pasture after milking, and when we came home we sought out Uncle Blair in the orchard. He was sauntering up and down Uncle Stephen&rsquo;s Walk, his hands clasped behind him and his beautiful, youthful face uplifted to the western sky where waves of night were breaking on a dim primrose shore of sunset.</p><p>&ldquo;See that star over there in the south-west?&rdquo; he said, as we joined him. &ldquo;The one just above that pine? An evening star shining over a dark pine tree is the whitest thing in the universe&mdash;because it is LIVING whiteness&mdash;whiteness possessing a soul. How full this old orchard is of twilight! Do you know, I have been trysting here with ghosts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
