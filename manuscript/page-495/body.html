If they do, I&rsquo;ll be sure to find it out and then our bargain is off. If I see you in church tomorrow, dressed as you are now, I&rsquo;ll give you my name and five dollars. But I won&rsquo;t see you. You&rsquo;ll shrink when you&rsquo;ve had time to think it over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cecily resolutely.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see. And now come out to the barn with me. I&rsquo;ve got the prettiest little drove of calves out there you ever saw. I want you to see them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
