When he came to Carlisle church he saw that service was going on there, and he concluded to stop and go in. But he didn&rsquo;t like to leave his oatmeal outside for fear something would happen to it, because there were always mischievous boys around, so he hoisted the bag on his back and walked into church with it and right to the top of the aisle to Grandfather King&rsquo;s pew.
