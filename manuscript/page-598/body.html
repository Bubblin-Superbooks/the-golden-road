<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then when autumn comes, the maples give up trying to be sober and flame out in all the barbaric splendour and gorgeousness of their real nature, making of the hills things out of an Arabian Nights dream in the golden prime of good Haroun Alraschid.</p><p>You may never know what scarlet and crimson really are until you see them in their perfection on an October hillside, under the unfathomable blue of an autumn sky. All the glow and radiance and joy at earth&rsquo;s heart seem to have broken loose in a splendid determination to express itself for once before the frost of winter chills her beating pulses. It is the year&rsquo;s carnival ere the dull Lenten days of leafless valleys and penitential mists come.</p></div> </div>
