Would he have wit enough to think of exploring the big, knobby ball for its delicate secret? And would he be at the dance after all?</p><p>&ldquo;The evening dragged by. Time had never seemed so long to Ursula. She could not rest or sleep. It was midnight before she heard the patter of a handful of gravel on her window-panes. In a trice she was leaning out. Below in the darkness stood Kenneth MacNair.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Kenneth, did you get my letter? And is it safe for you to be here?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Safe enough. Your father is in bed. I&rsquo;ve waited two hours down the road for his light to go out, and an extra half-hour to put him to sleep. The horses are there. Slip down and out, Ursula. We&rsquo;ll make Charlottetown by dawn yet.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
