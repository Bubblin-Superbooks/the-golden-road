All of us, in our hearts, though we never spoke of it to each other, thought Cecily was not as well as she ought to be that spring, and we hated to hear anything said which seemed in any way to touch or acknowledge the tiny, faint shadow which now and again showed itself dimly athwart our sunshine.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it was you began talking of being dead,&rdquo; said Felicity angrily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to talk of such things. Cecily, are you sure your feet ain&rsquo;t damp? We ought to go in anyhow&mdash;it&rsquo;s too chilly out here for you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
