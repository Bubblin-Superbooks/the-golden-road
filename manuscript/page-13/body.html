<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of something amusing for the winter,&rdquo; I said as we drew into a half-circle around the glorious wood-fire in Uncle Alec&rsquo;s kitchen.</p><p>It had been a day of wild November wind, closing down into a wet, eerie twilight. Outside, the wind was shrilling at the windows and around the eaves, and the rain was playing on the roof. The old willow at the gate was writhing in the storm and the orchard was a place of weird music, born of all the tears and fears that haunt the halls of night. But little we cared for the gloom and the loneliness of the outside world; we kept them at bay with the light of the fire and the laughter of our young lips.</p></div> </div>
