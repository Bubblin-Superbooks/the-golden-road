<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia and the Story Girl came over early for the day; and Peter came too, with his shining, morning face, to be hailed with joy, for we had been afraid that Peter would not be able to spend Christmas with us. His mother had wanted him home with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I ought to go,&rdquo; Peter had told me mournfully, &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t have turkey for dinner, because ma can&rsquo;t afford it. And ma always cries on holidays because she says they make her think of father. Of course she can&rsquo;t help it, but it ain&rsquo;t cheerful. Aunt Jane wouldn&rsquo;t have cried. Aunt Jane used to say she never saw the man who was worth spoiling her eyes for. But I guess I&rsquo;ll have to spend Christmas at home.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
