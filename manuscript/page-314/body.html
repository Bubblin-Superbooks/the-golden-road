Cecily and Felicity also had to have new dresses for the great event, and they talked of little else for a fortnight. Cecily declared that she hated to go to sleep because she was sure to dream that she was at Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s wedding in her old faded gingham dress and a ragged apron.</p><p>&ldquo;And no shoes or stockings,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t move, and everyone walks past and looks at my feet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only in a dream,&rdquo; mourned Sara Ray, &ldquo;but I may have to wear my last summer&rsquo;s white dress to the wedding. It&rsquo;s too short, but ma says it&rsquo;s plenty good for this summer. I&rsquo;ll be so mortified if I have to wear it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
