But your loss will be her gain. &ldquo;&lsquo;Au revoir, &ldquo;&lsquo;Your loving chum, SARA RAY.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That poor child,&rdquo; said the Story Girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, all I hope is that strangers won&rsquo;t take her for one of the family,&rdquo; remarked Felicity in a disgusted tone.</p><p>Aunt Olivia was married at five o&rsquo;clock in the orchard under the late apple tree. It was a pretty scene. The air was full of the perfume of apple bloom, and the bees blundered foolishly and delightfully from one blossom to another, half drunken with perfume. The old orchard was full of smiling guests in wedding garments. Aunt Olivia was most beautiful amid the frost of her bridal veil, and the Story Girl, in an unusually long white dress, with her brown curls clubbed up behind, looked so tall and grown-up that we hardly recognized her.</p></div> </div>
