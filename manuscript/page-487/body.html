<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Bev, don&rsquo;t you think the Story Girl is changing somehow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are times&mdash;just times&mdash;when she seems to belong more among the grown-ups than among us,&rdquo; I said, reluctantly, &ldquo;especially when she puts on her bridesmaid dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s the oldest of us, and when you come to think of it, she&rsquo;s fifteen,&mdash;that&rsquo;s almost grown-up,&rdquo; sighed Cecily. Then she added, with sudden vehemence, &ldquo;I hate the thought of any of us growing up. Felicity says she just longs to be grown-up, but I don&rsquo;t, not a bit. I wish I could just stay a little girl for ever&mdash;and have you and Felix and all the others for playmates right along. I don&rsquo;t know how it is&mdash;but whenever I think of being grown-up I seem to feel tired.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
