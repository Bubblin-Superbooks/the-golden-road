<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to tell her. I&rsquo;ve made it a rule to tell ma everything I do ever since the Judgment Day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Cecily seriously, &ldquo;the Family Guide says one ought to tell one&rsquo;s mother everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty hard sometimes, though,&rdquo; sighed Sara. &ldquo;Ma scolds so much when I do tell her things, that it sort of discourages me. But when I think of how dreadful I felt the time of the Judgment Day over deceiving her in some things it nerves me up. I&rsquo;d do almost anything rather than feel like that the next time the Judgment Day comes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
