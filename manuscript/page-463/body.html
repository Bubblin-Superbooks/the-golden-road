She put a peppermint in her own mouth and sucked it with gusto. We were relieved, for she did not talk during the process; but our relief was of short duration. A bevy of three very smartly dressed young ladies, sweeping past our pew, started Peg off again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yez needn&rsquo;t be so stuck up,&rdquo; she said, loudly and derisively. &ldquo;Yez was all of yez rocked in a flour barrel. And there&rsquo;s old Henry Frewen, still above ground. I called my parrot after him because their noses were exactly alike. Look at Caroline Marr, will yez? That&rsquo;s a woman who&rsquo;d like pretty well to get married, And there&rsquo;s Alexander Marr. He&rsquo;s a real Christian, anyhow, and so&rsquo;s his dog.</p></div> </div>
