I wasn&rsquo;t excited until it was all over because I hadn&rsquo;t time to be. The Story Girl and I were looking for eggs in the loft. It was filled with wheat straw nearly to the roof and it was an awful distance from us to the floor. And wheat straw is so slippery. I made a little spring and the straw slipped from under my feet and there I was going head first down from the loft. It seemed to me I was an awful long time falling, but the Story Girl says I couldn&rsquo;t have been more than three seconds. But I know that I thought five thoughts and there seemed to be quite a long time between them.</p></div> </div>
