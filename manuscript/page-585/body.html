<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going right away,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, more cheerfully. &ldquo;Not till the last of October. So we have over a month yet to have a good time in. Let&rsquo;s all just determine to make it a splendid month for the last. We won&rsquo;t think about my going at all till we have to, and we won&rsquo;t have any quarrels among us, and we&rsquo;ll just enjoy ourselves all we possibly can. So don&rsquo;t cry any more, Felicity. I&rsquo;m awfully glad you do like me and am sorry I&rsquo;m going away, but let&rsquo;s all forget it for a month.&rdquo;</p><p>Felicity sighed, and tucked away her damp handkerchief.</p></div> </div>
