<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We left Cousin Mattie&rsquo;s early, for it still looked like a storm, though no more so than it had in the morning. We intended to go home by a different path&mdash;one leading through cleared land overgrown with scrub maple, which had the advantage of being farther away from Peg Bowen&rsquo;s house. We hoped to be home before it began to storm, but we had hardly reached the hill above the village when a fine, driving snow began to fall. It would have been wiser to have turned back even then; but we had already come a mile and we thought we would have ample time to reach home before it became really bad. We were sadly mistaken; by the time we had gone another half-mile we were in the thick of a bewildering, blinding snowstorm. But it was by now just as far back to Cousin Mattie&rsquo;s as it was to Uncle Alec&rsquo;s, so we struggled on, growing more frightened at every step.</p></div> </div>
