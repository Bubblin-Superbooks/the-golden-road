<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And what do you think it was but a big umbrella with a white handle? Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away from him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it. I felt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella open when it wasent raining. But the Cowans do such queer things. You remember the time Jerry Cowan sold us God&rsquo;s picture. Amos took me right home and I was thankful for I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of me if he hadn&rsquo;t come along. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep all night and I never want to have any more adventures like that one.</p><p>CECILY KING.</p></div> </div>
