It should be like this for ever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us never come here again,&rdquo; said the Story Girl softly, &ldquo;never, no matter how often we may be in Carlisle. Then we will never see it changed or different. We can always remember it just as we see it now, and it will be like this for ever for us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
