<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pluck up your courage, and we&rsquo;ll let Townleys and MacNairs whistle their mouldy feuds down the wind while we sail southward in The Fair Lady. I have a plan.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me hear it,&rsquo; said Ursula, beginning to get back her breath.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is to be a dance at The Springs Friday night. Are you invited, Ursula?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good. I am not&mdash;but I shall be there&mdash;in the fir grove behind the house, with two horses. When the dancing is at its height you&rsquo;ll steal out to meet me. Then &lsquo;tis but a fifteen mile ride to Charlottetown, where a good minister, who is a friend of mine, will be ready to marry us. By the time the dancers have tired their heels you and I will be on our vessel, able to snap our fingers at fate.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
