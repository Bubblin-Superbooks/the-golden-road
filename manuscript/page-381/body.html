<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have a note from Sara Ray,&rdquo; said Cecily. &ldquo;Judy Pineau brought it up when she brought Mrs. Ray&rsquo;s spoons. Just let me read it to you:&mdash;</p><p>DEAREST CECILY:&mdash;A DREADFUL MISFORTUNE has happened to me. Last night I went with Judy to water the cows and in the spruce bush we found a WASPS&rsquo; NEST and Judy thought it was AN OLD ONE and she POKED IT WITH A STICK. And it was a NEW ONE, full of wasps, and they all flew out and STUNG US TERRIBLY, on the face and hands. My face is all swelled up and I can HARDLY SEE out of one eye. The SUFFERING was awful but I didn&rsquo;t mind that as much as being scared ma wouldn&rsquo;t take me to the wedding. But she says I can go and I&rsquo;m going. I know that I am a HARD-LOOKING SIGHT, but it isn&rsquo;t anything catching. I am writing this so that you won&rsquo;t get a shock when you see me.</p></div> </div>
