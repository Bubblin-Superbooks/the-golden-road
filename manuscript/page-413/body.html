<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But for two of us the adventures of the night were not yet over. Silence settled down over the old house&mdash;the eerie, whisperful, creeping silence of night. Felix and Dan were already sound asleep; I was drifting near the coast o&rsquo; dreams when I was aroused by a light tap on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Bev, are you asleep?&rdquo; came in the Story Girl&rsquo;s whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;No, what is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S-s-h. Get up and dress and come out. I want you.&rdquo;</p><p>With a good deal of curiosity and some misgiving I obeyed. What was in the wind now? Outside in the hall I found the Story Girl, with a candle in her hand, and her hat and jacket.</p></div> </div>
