She was truly vexed over the letter; and yet, so contradictory a thing is the feminine heart, even at twelve years old, I think she was a little flattered by it also. It was her first love letter and she confided to me that it gives you a very queer feeling to get it. At all events&mdash;the letter, though unanswered, was not torn up. I feel sure Cecily preserved it.</p></div> </div>
