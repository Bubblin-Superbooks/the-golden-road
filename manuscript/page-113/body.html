<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> (Peter, aside, in a gratified pig&rsquo;s whisper: &ldquo;I never was called &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; before.&rdquo;) Miss Felicity King&rsquo;s essays on Shakespeare is none the worse for being an old school composition, as it is new to most of our readers. Miss Cecily King contributes a thrilling article of adventure. The various departments are ably edited, and we feel that we have reason to be proud of Our Magazine. But we shall not rest on our oars. &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; shall ever be our motto. We trust that each succeeding issue will be better than the one that went before. We are well aware of many defects, but it is easier to see them than to remedy them. Any suggestion that would tend to the improvement of Our Magazine will be thankfully received, but we trust that no criticism will be made that will hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings.</p></div> </div>
