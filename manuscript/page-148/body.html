<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Accordingly we all filed in rather reluctantly. Great-aunt Eliza was toasting her toes&mdash;clad, as we noted, in very smart and shapely shoes&mdash;at the stove and looking quite at her ease. Cecily, determined to do her duty even in the face of such fearful odds as Great-aunt Eliza&rsquo;s deafness, dragged a ponderous, plush-covered album from its corner and proceeded to display and explain the family photographs. She did her brave best but she could not shout like Felicity, and half the time, as she confided to me later on, she felt that Great-aunt Eliza did not hear one word she said, because she didn&rsquo;t seem to take in who the people were, though, just like all deaf folks, she wouldn&rsquo;t let on. Great-aunt Eliza certainly didn&rsquo;t talk much; she looked at the photographs in silence, but she smiled now and then. That smile bothered me. It was so twinkly and so very un-great-aunt-Elizaish.</p></div> </div>
