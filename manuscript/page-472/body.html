She had promised that morning to tell us of &ldquo;the most tragic event that had ever been known on the north shore,&rdquo; and we now reminded her of her promise.</p><p>&ldquo;Some call it the &lsquo;Yankee Storm,&rsquo; and others the &lsquo;American Gale,&rsquo;&rdquo; she began, sitting down by Miss Reade and beaming, because the latter put her arm around her waist. &ldquo;It happened nearly forty years ago, in October of 1851.
