<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wish I could remember her,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, with a little sigh. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even a picture of her. Why didn&rsquo;t you paint one, father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She would never let me. She had some queer, funny, half-playful, half-earnest superstition about it. But I always meant to when she would become willing to let me. And then&mdash;she died. Her twin brother Felix died the same day. There was something strange about that, too. I was holding her in my arms and she was looking up at me; suddenly she looked past me and gave a little start. &lsquo;Felix!&rsquo; she said. For a moment she trembled and then she smiled and looked up at me again a little beseechingly. &lsquo;Felix has come for me, dear,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We were always together before you came&mdash;you must not mind&mdash;you must be glad I do not have to go alone.&rsquo; Well, who knows? But she left me, Sara&mdash;she left me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
