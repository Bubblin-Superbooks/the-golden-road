The Story Girl shed no tears, though the look in her eyes hurt more than weeping.</p><p>&ldquo;After all, perhaps it&rsquo;s for the best,&rdquo; she said drearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling so badly over having to go away and leave Paddy. No matter how kind you&rsquo;d all be to him I know he&rsquo;d miss me terribly. He wasn&rsquo;t like most cats who don&rsquo;t care who comes and goes as long as they get plenty to eat. Paddy wouldn&rsquo;t have been contented without me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
