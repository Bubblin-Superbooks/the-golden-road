She had been diligently collecting names for it ever since the preceding autumn and had a goodly number; but Kitty Marr had one more and this was certainly a fly in Cecily&rsquo;s ointment.</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, one I&rsquo;ve got isn&rsquo;t paid for&mdash;Peg Bowen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she lamented, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t suppose it ever will be, for I&rsquo;ll never dare to ask her for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it on at all,&rdquo; said Felicity.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t dare not to. She&rsquo;d be sure to find out I didn&rsquo;t and then she&rsquo;d be very angry. I wish I could get just one more name and then I&rsquo;d be contented. But I don&rsquo;t know of a single person who hasn&rsquo;t been asked already.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
