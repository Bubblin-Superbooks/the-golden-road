<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jasper Dale had a good farm, well cultivated; he had a large garden where he worked most of his spare time in summer; it was supposed that he read a great deal, since the postmistress declared that he was always getting books and magazines by mail. He seemed well contented with his existence and people let him alone, since that was the greatest kindness they could do him. It was unsupposable that he would ever marry; nobody ever had supposed it.</p><p>&ldquo;Jasper Dale never so much as THOUGHT about a woman,&rdquo; Carlisle oracles declared. Oracles, however, are not always to be trusted.</p><p>One day Mrs. Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious story, which she diligently spread far and wide. It made a good deal of talk, but people, although they listened eagerly, and wondered and questioned, were rather incredulous about it.</p></div> </div>
