I thought Peter was appointed fiction editor, but he has never written any fiction since the paper started. That&rsquo;s not MY idea of a fiction editor. He ought to make up stories out of his own head.&rdquo; PETER, SPUNKILY: &ldquo;I can do it, too, and I will next time. And it ain&rsquo;t easier to write true stories. It&rsquo;s harder, &lsquo;cause you have to stick to facts.&rdquo; FELICITY: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you could make up a story.&rdquo; PETER: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;)</p></div> </div>
