<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It just BREAKS MY HEART that you are going SO FAR AWAY. You have always been SO KIND to me and never hurt my feelings AS SOME DO and I shall miss you SO MUCH. But I earnestly HOPE AND PRAY that you will be HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS wherever YOUR LOT IS CAST and not be seasick on THE GREAT OCEAN. I hope you will find time AMONG YOUR MANY DUTIES to write me a letter ONCE IN A WHILE. I shall ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU and please remember me. I hope we WILL MEET AGAIN sometime, but if not may we meet in A FAR BETTER WORLD where there are no SAD PARTINGS. &ldquo;Your true and loving friend, &ldquo;SARA RAY&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor little Sara,&rdquo; said the Story Girl, with a queer catch in her voice, as she slipped the tear-blotted note into her pocket.</p></div> </div>
