You haven&rsquo;t heard my story yet. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been glad to see father if he&rsquo;d come back the same as he went away. But he is a changed man. He happened to go into a revival meeting one night this spring and he got converted. And he&rsquo;s come home to stay, and he says he&rsquo;s never going to drink another drop, but he&rsquo;s going to look after his family. Ma isn&rsquo;t to do any more washing for nobody but him and me, and I&rsquo;m not to be a hired boy any longer. He says I can stay with your Uncle Roger till the fall &lsquo;cause I promised I would, but after that I&rsquo;m to stay home and go to school right along and learn to be whatever I&rsquo;d like to be. I tell you it made me feel queer. Everything seemed to be upset.</p></div> </div>
