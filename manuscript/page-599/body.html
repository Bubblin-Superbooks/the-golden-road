Uncle Blair picked apples with us, and between him and the Story Girl it was an October never to be forgotten.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you go far afield for a walk with me to-day?&rdquo; he said to her and me, one idle afternoon of opal skies, pied meadows and misty hills.</p><p>It was Saturday and Peter had gone home; Felix and Dan were helping Uncle Alec top turnips; Cecily and Felicity were making cookies for Sunday, so the Story Girl and I were alone in Uncle Stephen&rsquo;s Walk.</p><p>We liked to be alone together that last month, to think the long, long thoughts of youth and talk about our futures. There had grown up between us that summer a bond of sympathy that did not exist between us and the others.</p></div> </div>
