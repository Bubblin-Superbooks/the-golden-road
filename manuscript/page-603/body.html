<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We went across the fields, intending to skirt the woods at the back of Uncle Alec&rsquo;s farm and find a lane that cut through Uncle Roger&rsquo;s woods; but before we came to it we stumbled on a sly, winding little path quite by accident&mdash;if, indeed, there can be such a thing as accident in the woods, where I am tempted to think we are led by the Good People along such of their fairy ways as they have a mind for us to walk in.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to, let us explore this,&rdquo; said Uncle Blair. &ldquo;It always drags terribly at my heart to go past a wood lane if I can make any excuse at all for traversing it: for it is the by-ways that lead to the heart of the woods and we must follow them if we would know the forest and be known of it.</p></div> </div>
