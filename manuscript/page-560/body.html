It was bright moonlight, and I felt just like getting up and going out to the orchard. But I knew that would be silly and of course I didn&rsquo;t go. But I kept on wanting to and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep any more.

A young mom was walking rosily on the hills as we passed down Uncle Stephen&rsquo;s Walk, with Paddy trotting before us. High overhead was the spirit-like blue of paling skies; the east was a great arc of crystal, smitten through with auroral crimsonings; just above it was one milk-white star of morning, like a pearl on a silver sea. A light wind of dawn was weaving an orient spell.</p></div> </div>
