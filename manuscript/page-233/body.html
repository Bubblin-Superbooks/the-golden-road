<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>(CECILY: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t ANY beau! I don&rsquo;t mean to think of such a thing for at least eight years yet!&rdquo;)</p><p>Miss Alice Reade of Charlottetown Royalty has come to Carlisle to teach music. She boards at Mr. Peter Armstrong&rsquo;s. The girls are all going to take music lessons from her. Two descriptions of her will be found in another column. Felix wrote one, but the girls thought he did not do her justice, so Cecily wrote another one. She admits she copied most of the description out of Valeria H. Montague&rsquo;s story Lord Marmaduke&rsquo;s First, Last, and Only Love; or the Bride of the Castle by the Sea, but says they fit Miss Reade better than anything she could make up.</p></div> </div>
