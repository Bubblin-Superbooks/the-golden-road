<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I would see you standing beside me in the old mirror at the end of the hall&mdash;a bride, in your pale blue dress, with a blush on your face. I would lead you through all the rooms made ready for your coming, and then to your own. I would see you sitting in your own chair and all my dreams would find rich fulfilment in that royal moment. Oh, Alice, we would have a beautiful life together! It&rsquo;s sweet to make believe about it. You will sing to me in the twilight, and we will gather early flowers together in the spring days. When I come home from work, tired, you will put your arms about me and lay your head on my shoulder. I will stroke it&mdash;so&mdash;that bonny, glossy head of yours.</p></div> </div>
