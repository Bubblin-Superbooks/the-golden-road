Mighty and sonorous was the music above our heads as the winds of the night stirred the great boughs tossing athwart the starlit sky. Perhaps it was that aeolian harmony which recalled to the Story Girl a legend of elder days.</p><p>&ldquo;I read such a pretty story in one of Aunt Olivia&rsquo;s books last night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was called &lsquo;The Christmas Harp.&rsquo; Would you like to hear it?
