That stuff was TOOTH-POWDER, that&rsquo;s what it was. Your Cousin Myra broke the bottle her tooth-powder was in when she was here last winter and I gave her that old can to keep it in. She forgot to take it when she went away and I put it on that top shelf. I declare you must all have been bewitched yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>Poor, poor Felicity! If she had not always been so horribly vain over her cooking and so scornfully contemptuous of other people&rsquo;s aspirations and mistakes along that line, I could have found it in my heart to pity her.</p></div> </div>
