She was Miss Reade&rsquo;s aunt and her name was Una, and I believe she must have been just like Miss Reade herself. Miss Reade told me all about her. When we went into the garden I saw in one corner of it an old stone bench arched over by a couple of pear trees and all grown about with grass and violets. And an old man was sitting on it&mdash;a bent old man with long, snow-white hair and beautiful sad blue eyes.</p></div> </div>
