Alice Reade, coming through the trees, with the wind blowing her little dark love-locks tricksily about under her wide blue hat, found a fragrant heap of mignonette under the pine.

But she saw him sitting on the rustic seat at the further side. His back was towards her, and he was partially screened by a copse of lilacs.</p><p>Alice, blushing slightly, unlatched the garden gate, and went down the path. She had never been in the garden before, and she found her heart beating in a strange fashion.</p></div> </div>
